# Java-Script-Notes-Term-1
## `Week - 8`
### Notes :

Assignment - Emagi Part (1)

**Front - End:**

File Name: (main.js)

### `Problem 1.`

So right now, our function is what's known (in lingo far too fancy for what it does) as the `"identity function"` it returns what it's given.

```javascript
const translateWord = require('./translate-word.js');

const userInput = process.argv[2];

const result = translateWord(userInput);

console.log(result);
```

* Step 1) When we call *require('./translate-word.js')* it goes into the (file path) and pulls what's in module.exports.
  
* Step 2) Grabs the userInput at index[2].  What was typed by the user in the terminal.
* Step 3)  That value is passed into translateWord back-end function.
* Step 4) It then returns it.
* Step 5) The return value is held in result.
* Step 6) Printed out with console.log(result).

### Notes:
* Naming: naming the file path the same is always good practice. 
  
* process.argv[2] = input from the terminal
* console.log() = output to the terminal

**Back - End:** 

File Name: (translate-word.js)

Identity Function: tests our understanding how all this data moves and the different parts.  Basic function prints out the word we typed in at index[2].
* translateWord is a variable that holds a function.

```javascript
const translateWord = function(word) {
    return word;
}

module.exports = translateWord;
```

### `Problem 2.`

The function bellow is taking in one word and verifying if that word is iin the emoji file.

* We need to loop through to see if there is a match.  

* We can loop through by using (const emoji of emojis)
* If the word typed in matches emoji.name it will return emoji.symbol.

Front End 
```javascript 
const translateWord = require('./translate-word.js');

const userInput = process.argv[2];

const result = translateWord(userInput);

console.log(result)
```
Back End
```Javascript 
const emojis = require('./emojis.js')

const translateWord = function(word) {
    for (const emoji of emojis) {
        if (emoji.name === word.toLowerCase()) {
            return emoji.symbol;
        }
    }
    return word;
}

module.exports = translateWord;
```
* The four loop is checking against the word we passed through.

* If it's not translatable and there is no matching emoji, it returns the word.
*  We're taking in a user's word? In your loop, for each emoji, compare its `name` property to the `word` parameter. If they're ever the same, return that emoji's `symbol` property.
*  The function translateWord has one job.  To take in one word and translate it 

### `Problem 3.`  
What if you type in `node main.js birthday cry`? We only get that first one.  But getting multiple words, or a full sentence, is a piece of cake!
*  So to take in an array of words we can use `.map`.
* `.map` says take this array of go through each element.  Call it with our helper function `translateWord` return the new array.
* No need to change our helper function.  

Front End 
```javascript
const translateWord = require('./translate-word.js');

const userInput = process.argv.slice(2);

console.log(userInput)

const translation = []

for (const word of userInput) {
    const translateWord = translateWord = translateWord(word)
    translation.push(translateWord);
}

console.log(translation); 
```
* map function 
* make a new array 
* `.push` into the new array
* this is the function version 

Clean version we use a `.map helper function`.

```javascript
const translateWord = require('./translate-word.js');

const userInput = process.argv(2);

const translation = userInput.map(translateWord)

console.log(translation.join(' '));
```
* This gives an array with some emoji symbols that match the word. 

* The `console.log(translation.join(' '));`.
* `.join` takes an array and makes it into a string.
* Translate goes word by word. `Cry in your fries` becomes `üò≠ in your üçü`

### `Problem 4.` 
Back End:
Function 

File Name:`(encode-word.js)`

Encoding means changing every LETTER in the input. We would represent this as a loop within a loop. `(In the example, it would be 'üåµüëΩüëÖ' for cat).`  We are changing it for one word.

```javascript 
const emojis = require('./emojis.js');

const encodeWord = function(word) {
    let result = '';
    for (const letter of word) {
        for (const emoji of emojis) {
            if (emoji.letter === letter) {
                result += emoji.symbol;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}

module.exports = encodeWord;
```
* Double Loop
* for `(const letter of word)` it's looping through every letter of our word.
*   For every letter we want to loop through our emojis `(const emoji of emojis)`.
*   It is being put on `let result = 'string'`
*   Check for a match if `(emoji.letter === letter).`  

Front End 

File Name:`(main.js)`

```javascript
const encodeWord = require('./encode-word.js')

const userInput = process.argv[2]

console.log(encodeWord(userInput))
```
* Run the word into `encodeWord(userInput)`

*  Finally, after both loops are done, return our result.

### Problem 5 

`Cry in your fries` becomes `üåµü§ñ‚òØ üç¶üì∞ ‚òØüêôü¶Ñü§ñ üçüü§ñüç¶üêòüíÄ`, with every letter becoming an emoji standing for that letter.
* No need to change the backend function just the front end to accommodate for the words after `process.argv[2].`

Front End
File Name: `(main.js)` 
```javascript 
const encodeWord  = require('./encode-word.js');

const userInput = process.argv.slice(2);

const encodedSentence = userInput.map(encodeWord)
 
console.log(encodedSentence.join(' '));
```
* Similar to what was used in translateWord Front End.
